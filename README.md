Remake of Rapid Roll with Lua

I have made a remake of a game called Rapid Roll which I played on old Nokia phones.

Goal of the game is pretty simple. Get as far down as you can without hitting the obstacles. You will die everytime u hit the spikes on top and also the orange aliens. You will also die if you fall off too far down the game frame. The speed of scrolling increases everytime your score is a multiple of 40. I have added retro sound effects.

Open the file called game with LOVE to run the game.
